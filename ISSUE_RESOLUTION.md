# Issue Resolution Guide

## üîê Staging Environment Security Issue - RESOLVED

### **Issue Description:**
The staging environment credentials were exposed in public documentation, creating a security vulnerability where unauthorized users could access the staging environment.

### **Root Cause:**
- Staging environment credentials were hardcoded in public documentation
- No proper access controls were in place for the staging environment
- Credentials were visible in README and other public files

### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **1. Credential Management**
- ‚úÖ **Moved credentials to AWS Secrets Manager**: All staging credentials now stored securely in `staging-auth` secret
- ‚úÖ **Removed hardcoded credentials**: Eliminated all hardcoded passwords from public documentation
- ‚úÖ **Updated deployment scripts**: Modified `deploy-staging-auth.js` to use Secrets Manager

#### **2. Documentation Security**
- ‚úÖ **Removed staging links from README**: Eliminated public access to staging environment URLs
- ‚úÖ **Updated documentation**: Removed all references to staging credentials in public docs
- ‚úÖ **Added SECURITY.md**: Created internal documentation for deployment procedures

#### **3. Access Control**
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced authentication**: Improved staging environment login system
- ‚úÖ **Secure credential retrieval**: All credentials now retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager
- ‚úÖ **Environment isolation**: Proper separation between staging and production environments

### **Current Status:**
- **Production**: Public access maintained at `https://d14l4o1um83q49.cloudfront.net`
- **Staging**: Password protected with credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Documentation**: All public docs cleaned of sensitive information
- **Security**: Enhanced with proper credential management

### **Prevention Measures:**
1. **Never commit credentials** to public repositories
2. **Use AWS Secrets Manager** for all sensitive data
3. **Regular security audits** of documentation
4. **Environment-specific access controls**
5. **Automated credential rotation** procedures

### **Deployment Process:**
```bash
# Update staging credentials securely
aws secretsmanager update-secret \
  --secret-id staging-auth \
  --secret-string '{"username":"new_user","password":"new_password"}'

# Deploy updated authentication
node scripts/deploy-staging-auth.js
```

## Previous Issues

## Problem
A user encountered a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error when trying to start the backend:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'better-sqlite3'
```

This occurred because the `better-sqlite3` package was missing from the `backend/package.json` dependencies.

## Solution & Improvements

### 1. Immediate Fix
- **Added `better-sqlite3` to `backend/package.json` dependencies**
- **Created `setup.sh` script** to automate dependency installation for both backend and frontend
- **Updated README** with troubleshooting section for missing module errors

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- **Created `start.sh` script** for ultra-simplified startup:
  - Auto-detects if dependencies are installed
  - Runs `setup.sh` if needed
  - Starts both backend and frontend with one command
- **Simplified Quick Start** in README from 3 steps to 2 steps:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Mihirgupta25/open-source-tracker.git
  cd open-source-tracker
  ./start.sh  # That's it!
  ```

### 3. Project Organization
- **Created `backend/scripts/` folder** for better organization
- **Moved all collection scripts** to the new folder:
  - `star_tracker_3hr.js`
  - `pr_velocity_daily.js`
  - `pr_ratio_historical.js`
  - `pr_velocity_historical.js`
- **Updated all documentation** to reflect new structure

### 4. New Features Added
- **Issue Health Section**: New graph showing closed/open issue ratios
- **Enhanced PR Velocity**: Fixed data visibility and date formatting issues
- **Automated Data Collection**: 
  - Star growth every 3 hours
  - PR velocity daily at 12:00 PM PST

### 5. Technical Improvements
- **Fixed backend API** to return correct data format for PR velocity
- **Improved frontend data processing** with proper error handling
- **Enhanced date formatting** with timezone-safe parsing
- **Added comprehensive error handling** throughout the application

### 6. Documentation Updates
- **Added troubleshooting section** for common setup issues
- **Created detailed setup instructions** with multiple options
- **Updated project structure** documentation
- **Added quick start guide** for new users

## Result
The project now has:
- ‚úÖ **Zero-friction setup** with single-command startup
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive error handling** and troubleshooting guides
- ‚úÖ **Well-organized codebase** with clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ **Three main metrics**: Star Growth, PR Velocity, and Issue Health
- ‚úÖ **Automated data collection** running continuously
- ‚úÖ **Professional documentation** for easy onboarding

## Key Files Created/Modified
- `setup.sh` - Automated dependency installation
- `start.sh` - Ultra-simplified startup script
- `backend/scripts/` - Organized script folder
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `backend/package.json` - Fixed dependencies
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Added Issue Health section
- `backend/index.js` - Added issue health API endpoint

The initial `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error led to a complete overhaul of the project's setup process, making it much more user-friendly and robust for future users.
