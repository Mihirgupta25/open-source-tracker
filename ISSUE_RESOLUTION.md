# Issue Resolution: MODULE_NOT_FOUND Error for better-sqlite3

## Problem
A user encountered a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error when trying to start the backend:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'better-sqlite3'
```

This occurred because the `better-sqlite3` package was missing from the `backend/package.json` dependencies.

## Solution & Improvements

### 1. Immediate Fix
- **Added `better-sqlite3` to `backend/package.json` dependencies**
- **Created `setup.sh` script** to automate dependency installation for both backend and frontend
- **Updated README** with troubleshooting section for missing module errors

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- **Created `start.sh` script** for ultra-simplified startup:
  - Auto-detects if dependencies are installed
  - Runs `setup.sh` if needed
  - Starts both backend and frontend with one command
- **Simplified Quick Start** in README from 3 steps to 2 steps:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Mihirgupta25/open-source-tracker.git
  cd open-source-tracker
  ./start.sh  # That's it!
  ```

### 3. Project Organization
- **Created `backend/scripts/` folder** for better organization
- **Moved all collection scripts** to the new folder:
  - `star_tracker_3hr.js`
  - `pr_velocity_daily.js`
  - `pr_ratio_historical.js`
  - `pr_velocity_historical.js`
- **Updated all documentation** to reflect new structure

### 4. New Features Added
- **Issue Health Section**: New graph showing closed/open issue ratios
- **Enhanced PR Velocity**: Fixed data visibility and date formatting issues
- **Automated Data Collection**: 
  - Star growth every 3 hours
  - PR velocity daily at 12:00 PM PST

### 5. Technical Improvements
- **Fixed backend API** to return correct data format for PR velocity
- **Improved frontend data processing** with proper error handling
- **Enhanced date formatting** with timezone-safe parsing
- **Added comprehensive error handling** throughout the application

### 6. Documentation Updates
- **Added troubleshooting section** for common setup issues
- **Created detailed setup instructions** with multiple options
- **Updated project structure** documentation
- **Added quick start guide** for new users

## Result
The project now has:
- ✅ **Zero-friction setup** with single-command startup
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** and troubleshooting guides
- ✅ **Well-organized codebase** with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ **Three main metrics**: Star Growth, PR Velocity, and Issue Health
- ✅ **Automated data collection** running continuously
- ✅ **Professional documentation** for easy onboarding

## Key Files Created/Modified
- `setup.sh` - Automated dependency installation
- `start.sh` - Ultra-simplified startup script
- `backend/scripts/` - Organized script folder
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `backend/package.json` - Fixed dependencies
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Added Issue Health section
- `backend/index.js` - Added issue health API endpoint

The initial `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error led to a complete overhaul of the project's setup process, making it much more user-friendly and robust for future users.
